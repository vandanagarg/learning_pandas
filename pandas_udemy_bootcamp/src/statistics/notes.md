# Statistical Concepts

1. Before descriptive statistics or finding mean/median/etc. we should
visualize the data to get a very first impression.
2. So histogram is a good choice for graphical representation of absolute frequency distribution.
3. Mean is sensitive to outliers, median is not sensitive to outliers.
4. Arithmetic mean is higher/larger than the geometric mean as per the general rule.
