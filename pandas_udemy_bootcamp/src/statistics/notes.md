# Statistical Concepts

1. Before descriptive statistics or finding mean/median/etc. we should
visualize the data to get a very first impression.
2. So histogram is a good choice for graphical representation of absolute frequency distribution.
3. Mean is sensitive to outliers, median is not sensitive to outliers.
4. Arithmetic mean is higher/larger than the geometric mean as per the general rule.
5. scipy.stats is a very important library in which almost 99% od all statistics functions can be calculated.
6. Cumulative plots/calculations always sums up to one.
7. Variance is for a single variable or covariance of variable with itself is variance.
8. Covariance is between two random variable. It's always calculated for a sample not for population.
Hence the degree of freedom is always (n-1) for an unbiased estimate for covariance and not n.
