# Reshaping and Pivoting DataFrames

#### Points covered:
* how to optimize your data for data presentation.
* The optimal shape for data presentation purposes can differ from the most functional shape. Therefore, the paradigm "observations in rows and features in columns" will be relaxed in this Section. 
* how to pivot, aggregate and group data with the methods:

```python
pivot()
pivot_table()
pd.crosstab()
```
* All what can be done with these three methods can also be done with a combination of groupby() and unstack(), and even more.
* Recommendation: Master groupby() and know the few cases, where pivot() or pd.crosstab() might be a convenient alternative!
