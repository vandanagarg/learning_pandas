* NaN - Not a number or missing values.
* Object datatype - For string or text data or Mixed data types.
* Pandas is a class.
* Pandas data frame is a datatype.
* Pandas series is a datatype too - it shows only one column/row. It is a one dimensional labelled array.
* It is called labelled since it contains rows/columns data along with the indexes of the data frame.

#### Position based indexing

* Selecting/Slicing a particular element/row/column is called position based indexing using iloc[].
* Zero based indexing and negative indexing are two concepts limited to python.
* Zero based indexing is that the indexes will start from "0" and is valid for data frames as well.
* Negative indexing is that the indexes from the last element will start from "-1" and is valid for data frames as well.
