# Pandas (v 1.0)

Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.

_**Documentation**_: [pandas_documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)

In short pandas has powerful data structures for data analysis, time series, and statistics.
Also, it is well suited for many different kinds of data.

_**Course details**_: Udemy - [The Complete Pandas Bootcamp 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-pandas-bootcamp/).

The plus point of this course is that it covers the latest version of pandas(v 1.0)

Below are the details what I have learnt in this course and where you can find the resources of all the topics.

In repository **[learning_pandas](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas)** under folder **[pandas_udemy_bootcamp](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp)**, I have maintained all the code and projects that I have worked on while learning pandas.

You can find all code and analysis that I have performed under folder **[src](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src)**.

Folder **[pandas_notes](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/pandas_notes)** contains notes related to pandas important points/concepts.

I have divided and structured the code in src folder as per the sections covered or concepts related to pandas. Given below are the links and rest details of the folders:

Folder **[utilities](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/utilities)** and **[config_file.py](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/blob/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/indexing_slicing/config_file.py)** module present inside folders contains configuration details to modify sys.path parameter.
Also, I have kept all my raw data in a separate folder and this module helps me to configure absolute path to read raw data files.

1. **[pandas_basics](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/pandas_basics)**
contains code related to creating dataframes from csv files, basic manipulations within dataframes(row/columns) and usage of some simple methods for analyzing data just to get an overview of it.

2. **[dataframe_filtering](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/dataframe_filtering)**
code related to various data filtering techniques/methods to filter data within a dataframe if a particular condition is met.

3. **[indexing_slicing](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/indexing_slicing)**
implemented various techniques/concepts to perform indexing/slicing operations on a dataframe.

4. **[numpy](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/numpy)**
contains all the basics and different concepts related to numpy package which is the base for pandas framework.

There are 3 main data types in pandas: Pandas Dataframe, Pandas Series, Index Object

5. **[pandas_index_objects](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/pandas_index_objects)**
this folder contains concepts and implementation for 3rd data type of pandas:- Index Objects.

6. **[pandas_series](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/pandas_series)**
this folder contains concepts and implementation for 2nd data type of pandas:- Pandas Series, which is also referred as 1D array.

7. **[visualization](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/visualization)**
contains different visualization techniques/methods for plotting final data sets using various packages namely matplotlib.


8. **[statistics](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas/tree/master/pandas_udemy_bootcamp/src/statistics)**
contains implementation of various statistical concepts needed to analyse and plot final data sets.
