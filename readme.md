# Pandas Framework - Python

Hello all! This repo **[learning_pandas](https://github.com/vandanagarg/learning_pandas)** is for practicing [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library/framework. Pandas stands for “Python Data Analysis Library”. According to the Wikipedia page on Pandas, “the name is derived from the term “[panel data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data)”, an [econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) term for multidimensional structured data sets.” But it’s just a cute/simple name to a super-useful Python library!

Pandas is quite a game changer when it comes to analyzing data with Python and it is one of the most preferred and widely used tools in data analysis if not THE most used one. Pandas is an open source library.
